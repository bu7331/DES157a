    <h1>User Test</h1>
    <h2>Things I Learned</h2>
    <section>
        <p>It is pretty clear for users on what they need to do to progress in my project. Even though I provided no instructions on how to get from the outside of the box to the inside of the box, all three user testers clicked on the keyhole to access the inside contents. There wasn’t even a hover state for the keyhole.</p>
        <p>I need to make it more clear which items are clickable. While I did add hover states to the objects that were clickable, the user testers seemed to click on the same items multiple times to see if something would happen. This caused a delay in the flow of exploring the page. 
        </p>
        <p>My project is missing some desirable interactions. The user testers were clicking on things that could potentially have an interaction but did not at the time. </p>
    </section>

    <h2>How this will be applied</h2>
    <section>
        <p>For my final project, I plan on adding distinct hover states to the keyhole and clickable objects to make it more clear to the user where they need to click to progress in the project. I also need to make it more clear that there are items that aren’t clickable and that the user needs to look for the objects that are. I will also add different audios for each overlay and make small interactions for the keychain to make the experience more fun and engaging for the user.
