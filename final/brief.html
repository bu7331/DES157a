    <h1>Project Brief - Every Picture Project</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I’ll be adding and improving upon my Every Picture Project by adding more interactive elements to create a more nostalgic and meaningful experience. </p>

    <h2>Comparison Project</h2>
    <div id="img">
        <figure>
            <img src="images/hover state name.png">
            <figcaption>Person's name appears when hovering over their card</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/one.png">
            <img src="images/two.png">
            <img src="images/three.png">
            <figcaption>Slides switch to the next one when the user scrolls down</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <a href="https://unfold.co/">unfold site link</a>
    </div>
    <p>The purpose of the site is to showcase the work and provide info about a group of designers. Their goal is to present their project and selves in a way that will get people to hire them. Their intentions with their site may be different from mine, but the interactions on their site are similar to what I want to use in my own project. They use overlays when hovering over a person’s profile so that their name pops up without taking any extra space on the page. They also use scroll transitions to switch between pages on the home display when you scroll up or down. 
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>Continue my every picture project by making it seem more like someone going through a box containing items that are meaningful to me and my friends; making it a personal yet fun experience for the user to go through.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>Create a short experience with a dreamy/pastel color palette. Draw the user in with a nostalgic feeling through scrapbook-like textures and images. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>Have hover states that highlight objects and slightly enlarge them when the user puts their mouse over it. I also want to create an animation where there is a quick zoom in transition between outside of the box to the inside of the box. It would also like to add an audio element where there is a sound of keys clinking or paper rustling when hovering over certain objects. 
    </p>

    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>While the objects shown on my page are personal to me, I want the user to experience a sort of nostalgic and happy feeling by seeing the connection I have with my certain objects. I plan to articulate this through the written content, images, and calming background music.
