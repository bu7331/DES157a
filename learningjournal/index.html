    <p>When it comes to forms, the article discusses how the designer of the forms should take into account what the easiest flow is for the user and how to limit user error. Because forms are often thought of as a tedious and boring process that someone just has to get out of the way, making it so that the process is easy and time efficient is important. The article emphasizes a lot about speed and formatting the form so that the user can easily fill it out without getting confused on what they do and minimizing the amount of interactions. This can be done by putting easy questions at the top of the form and complex questions last so that the user does not give up in the beginning and feels more committed to filling out the entire thing. When designing a form, it is also important to group similar information together with their respective labels nearby so that the user is not confused on what they need to input. One thing the article pointed out was the uselessness of inline labels, for the label disappears when the user inputs something. Therefore, if the user forgets what they are supposed to be inputting, then they have to delete everything to see the label again. This spoke to me personally because I am a very forgetful person and this happens to me often, so I rather appreciate labels outside of the input area.

    <p>The form I use the most is probably Google forms, which I think is generally user friendly because there is a clear distinction between the input areas. However, I think the convenience of the form is highly dependent on the person who makes it, because sometimes there is a lot of intro information provided about the formâ€™s purpose at the top that the user has to read first to progress through the rest of the form.

    <p>Forms that are always the worst to fill out are medical forms, for the input areas are usually in a mixture of long rows and columns that sort of blend together on the page. There is also just a lot of information to fill out in general in addition to different descriptions of what input is for, such as insurance information, medication information, biological information, etc.
